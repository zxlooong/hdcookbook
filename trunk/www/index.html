This is an open, collaborative place to gather useful code for Blu-ray Java, and other GEM terminal specifications like MHP, OCAP, and GEM-IPTV. If you have something you'd like to contribute, please do!  All we ask is a little bit of coordination on package names, and a few simple formatting conventions.  Here's what we have so far: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="javadocs/grin/com/hdcookbook/grin/doc-files/index.html">GRIN -  a framework for Graphical Interactivity.</a>  This framework manages the display of &quot;features&quot; that are arranged into a &quot;show&quot;, and provides simple remote control handling.  It grew out of a prototype MHP application written for the DVD forum by Sun, Technicolor and NDS France in November of 2004.  In 2006 it found new life in BD-Java as the basis of the interactivity for a demo shown at CES 2007. </li><li>A set of three xlets that can be used in a BD disc image.     There's a main menu xlet that uses GRIN in the package     <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.menu</strong>, a game called &quot;Gun Bunny&quot;     in <strong>com.hdcookbook.gunbunny</strong>, and a &quot;monitor xlet&quot; to control     the other apps in <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.monitor</strong>. </li><li>A tool to build a Blu-ray Disc BDJO file in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdjo</strong>, under the tools directory.<br /></li><li>A tool to sign a Blu-ray Disc jar files in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdsigner</strong>, under the tools directory.</li><li>A set of ant scripts you can use to build the tools and the xlets.  <br /></li><li>A set of shell scripts you can use as a starting point to set up     a build environment.  These can be found in the &quot;scripts&quot; directory.</li></ul> <p> Go find all these, you'll need to hook up to the SVN repository and do a bringover.  That process is described in the java.net pages. When I wrote this, there was a link for &quot;Subversion&quot; under &quot;Project tools&quot; that explained how to do this.  We keep milestone snapshots in the archived_versions directory of the SVN repository.  Each is in a zip file with a long, descriptive name. </p><p> By the way, the name &quot;HD Cookbook&quot; is inspired by the title of an  upcoming book on developing interactive applications for Blu-ray Java and other optical media standards.  See <a href="http://hdcookbook.com">http://hdcookbook.com</a> for more about this book, and a list of other Blu-ray resources. </p><p> A discussion forum for BD-J is available <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=117">here</a>, with a linked mailing list. <a href="https://hdcookbook.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=bd-j-dev">Join the discussion here!</a> </p> <h2>License</h2> <p> The contents of hdcookbook.dev.java.net are covered  by <a href="misc/license.html">this license</a>. </p>
