<h2>HDcookbook - a place for Blu-ray Disc Java and GEM</h2>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p> Welcome to the HD Cookbook source repository!  This is an open, 
collaborative place to gather useful code for Blu-ray Java, and other 
GEM terminal specifications like MHP, OCAP, and GEM-IPTV. If you 
have something you'd like to contribute, please do!  All we ask 
is a little bit of coordination on package names, and a few simple 
formatting conventions.  Here's what we have so far: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> <a href="animator.html">Animator</a>, a lightweight animation package.
         This package manages the animation loop, drawing optimization, 
	 and double-buffering for a Java Xlet, such as a BD-J application.
    <li> <a href="grin.html">GRIN -
	a framework for Graphical Interactivity.</a>  This framework uses the
	animation framework described above, and adds a "scene graph" to it.
	A scene graph is the thing that, at runtime, represents what gets
	built with a visual design tool.  It's a tree of objects that 
	represents drawing operations, much like an HTML document or a 
	Flash file.
    <li>A set of three Blu-ray Java xlets that can be used in a BD disc 
        image.  There's a main menu xlet that uses GRIN in the package
    <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.menu</strong>, a game 
    called &quot;Gun Bunny&quot; in <strong>com.hdcookbook.gunbunny</strong>, 
    and a &quot;monitor xlet&quot; to control
    the other apps in <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.monitor</strong>.


    <li>A BD disc image with A/V assets, ready to have the three xlets
        described above added to it.  Put these together on a BD-RE disc,
	and you have a disc image you can play on an off-the-shelf
	Blu-Ray Disc player, like the PS/3!
    <li>A tool to build a Blu-ray Disc BDJO file 
    in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdjo</strong>, under the tools directory.
    <li>A tool to sign a Blu-ray Disc jar files 
    in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdsigner</strong>, under the tools directory.
    <li>A set of ant scripts you can use to build the tools and the xlets. 
    <li>A set of shell scripts you can use as a starting point to set up a 
build environment.  These can be found in the &quot;scripts&quot; directory.
</ul> 
<p>
This code is being used in production Blu-ray titles, including
major studio releases.

<h2>Blu-ray Java resources</h2>
<p>
Many Blu-ray resources are listed at
    <a href="http://hdcookbook.com">http://hdcookbook.com</a> under
    "Blu-ray Disc Java Resources."  This includes a
    BD-J <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=117">discussion forum</a>
        and linked <a href="https://hdcookbook.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=bd-j-dev">mailing list</a>.

<h2>Playing a Blu-ray Disc Image at Home</h2>
<p>
By assembling the parts available here, you can build your own
Blu-ray disc image, and burn it to a rewritable BD-RE disc.  This
disc can be played almost all consumer players, including the PS/3.
You can also modify the BD-J code provided, or write your own.  Soon,
we hope to assmeble enough tools so you can build a disc image from
scratch:  We'd like it to be possible for folks who are interested to
shoot their own HD footage, edit it with something like Final Cut,
build the disc data structures, write code for the interactivity, and
emerge with a BD-RE disc that will work on a normal Blu-ray player.
<p>For everything but the disc image, you'll need to hook up to 
the SVN repository and 
do a bringover.  That process is described in the java.net pages.  When 
I wrote this, there was a link for &quot;Subversion&quot; under 
&quot;Project tools&quot; that explained how to do this.  We 
keep milestone snapshots in the archived_versions directory of the 
SVN repository.  Each is in a zip file with a long, descriptive name. </p>
<p>
For the disc image, look under "Documents &amp; Files" on the menu bar
on the right, then grab the file 2007_10_hdcookbook_disc_image_no_jar_bdjo.zip.
An earlier version from August is also available, but that version has
an AACS directory and has content protection flags set in the transport
streams.  This was fixed in the October disc image, which is known to
play correctly on a PS/3 (once the xlets are compiled and added to the
image).
</p>
<p> By the way, the name &quot;HD Cookbook&quot; is inspired by the title of a
book on developing interactive applications for Blu-ray Java and the other 
HD optical media format.  
See <a href="http://hdcookbook.com">http://hdcookbook.com</a> for 
more about this book, and a list of other Blu-ray resources. </p>
<p> A discussion forum for BD-J is 
available <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=117">here</a>,
