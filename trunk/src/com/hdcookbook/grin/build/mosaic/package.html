This package contains a program that reads a show file, and
transforms all image assets to a mosaic.  It does this using a
fairly brute-force "first fit" algorithm that's almost certainly
non-optimal, but is sufficient at least to demonstrate the concept
of a mosaic.  When run, this program produces a modified show file, 
and a modified set of assets to be used by that show file.

This is a build-time tool that runs with the JDK.  It requires parts
of the GRIN library to run, so you should probably just build the
whole thing.  In order to test this with Ryan's Life, you can try
something like this:
</p>
<pre>

    rm -rf build/classes/compiled_assets
    java -Xmx512m -cp build/classes com.hdcookbook.grin.build.mosaic.Main \
	    -assets /com/hdcookbook/grin/test/assets/ \
	    -show ryan_show.txt  \
	    -out build/classes/compiled_assets

    java -cp build/classes com.hdcookbook.grin.test.bigjdk.GrinTestRyan \
	    -assets /com/hdcookbook/grin/test/assets/ -assets /compiled_assets \
	    -imagemap images.map

</pre>
<p>
As of this writing, the mosaic isn't optimized, and the mosaic image
can only be in PNG.  Some players decode JPEG faster than PNG, but
JPEG doesn't support alpha and you have to worry about setting the
quality of JPEG output if you go that route.  This tool presently
doesn't have a way of grouping related images together, which would
be important for managing image loading and unloading if you can't
just keep everything in memory.
