This is a test for the Progressive Playlist.  To simplify the setup, the files used for the progressive playlist is created and bundled into the disc image (under BDMV/JAR/vfs.jar).   The xlet unzips the content into the binding unit data area, performs the vfs update, enables the clip, and plays back the video that is listed as a progressive playlist asset in the VFS update.
