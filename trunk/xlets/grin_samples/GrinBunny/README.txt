This is an arcade-style game called "GrinBunny."  It is a rewrite
of the Gun Bunny game that is included in the HD cookbook
disc image.  This version is built using the GRIN framework, 
and shows how Java code can drive a GRIN scene graph to produce 
this kind of game.

For the original, see xlets/hdcookbook_discimage/gunbunny.
