This directory contains various GRIN demos.  They aren't included in
the stand-alone build, and each one is done with its own
independent build system.  That is, each one needs its own
user.vars.properties to be able to build it.

These should be considered "use at your own risk" - we don't
maintin them.  We do try pretty hard to make sure that GRIN
maintains backwards compatibility, but it's possible that bitrot 
might set in some day...
