
This project contains some of the security tools required for
developing BD-J Applications.
  
Here is the list of tools we currently have:

1. BDCertGenerator - generates the root and application certificates
   according to BD-J Specification.
2) BDSigner -- signs the jars using keys generated by the BDCertGenerator.
3) BDCredentialSigner --Generates the file credentials and signs the jar file.
For more information in this tool please refer to the CREDENTIALS-README.TXT

Example:

Step 1: Use the BDCertGenerator to generate certificates/keys.
-------
The mandatory argument for this tool is organization id.
For other options type: BDCertGenerator -help.

java -cp $SECURITY_HOME/build/security.jar:$JDK_HOME/lib/tools.jar:$SECURITY_HOME/resource/bcprov-jdk15-137.jar net.java.bd.tools.security.BDCertGenerator 56789abc

Place the generated root certificate file, app.discroot.crt, in the BDMV's CERTIFICATE directory.

Step 2: Use the BDSigner to sign the jar{s} using the key generated at Step 1.
-------
The mandatory argument for this tool is one or more jarfiles.
For other options type: BDSigner -help.

java -cp $SECURITY_HOME/build/security.jar:$JDK_HOME/lib/tools.jar:$SECURITY_HOME/resource/bcprov-jdk15-137.jar net.java.bd.tools.security.BDSigner 00000.jar 


BDsigner is built on top of JDK's jarsigner which is bundled in tools.jar 

bdprov-jdk15-137.jar is an open source, bouncycastle distribution;
a copy can be bound at "resources" dir. We use release 137 built for JDK 5.0.

========================

Why can't we just use the standard "jarsigner" tool in Java SE?

Blu-Ray specification requires an extra header in the signature 
manifest file in signed jar files.  The signature manifest file 
must have an attribute called "BDJ-Signature-Version" with the 
value of "1.0". Please refer to the section "12.1.4.2" of the
"System Description Blu-Ray Disc Read-Only Format - Part 3
Audio Visual Basic Specifications" - DRAFT Version 2.02".

The "jarsigner" tool in Java SE generates signature manifest 
file automatically. There is no way to specify extensions to 
the signature manifest file. So, it can not be used to sign
jars for BD-J.
