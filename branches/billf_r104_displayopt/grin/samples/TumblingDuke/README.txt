This is meant to be the simplest GRIN script example.

The helloworld.txt GRIN script has only one real element - a static image.  
The tumblingduke.txt GRIN script has a sequence of image to flip through.
You can run the script directly using grin_viewer.  The "run_grinview" target in build.xml will execute the viewer.

The HelloGrinWorld xlet is a simple BD-J application that displays the grin show structure. 
It parses the script and displays the image directly to the root container (HScene).
