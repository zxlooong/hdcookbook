This xlet is the equivalent of the "grinviewer" program for big JDK.
It lets you read in any GRIN show, and select different segments
using the remote control.  Like it's JDK cousin, it also lets you
step through the execution of the script to test things out.

The GRIN script in this directory has a collection of segments that
test and demonstrate various features of GRIN.  See the comments in
show.txt to see what's there -- they should all be described pretty
thoroughly.
