This directory has a little shooting game in it.  It's built up
progressively, from version 01, which is a minimal GRIN scenegraph
to put a picture of a shoe on the screen, up to version 07, which
is the full game.  It was done like this for use at a talk, trying
to show the stepwise development process.
