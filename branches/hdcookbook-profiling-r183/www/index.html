<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p> Welcome to the HD Cookbook source repository!  This is an open, c
ollaborative place to gather useful code for Blu-ray Java, and other G
EM terminal specifications like MHP, OCAP, and GEM-IPTV. If you h
ave something you'd like to contribute, please do!  All we ask i
s a little bit of coordination on package names, and a few simple f
ormatting conventions.  Here's what we have so far: </p>
<ul> 
    <li> <a href="javadocs/grin/com/hdcookbook/grin/doc-files/index.html">GRIN -
    a framework for Graphical Interactivity.</a>  This framework manages the 
    display of &quot;features&quot; that are arranged into 
    a &quot;show&quot;, and provides simple remote control handling.  It 
    grew out of a prototype MHP application written for the DVD forum 
    by Sun, Technicolor and NDS France in November of 2004.  In 2006 
    it found new life in BD-Java as the basis of the interactivity for a 
    demo shown at CES 2007.

    <li>A set of three xlets that can be used in a BD disc image.  There's 
    a main menu xlet that uses GRIN in the package
    <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.menu</strong>, a game 
    called &quot;Gun Bunny&quot; in <strong>com.hdcookbook.gunbunny</strong>, 
    and a &quot;monitor xlet&quot; to control
    the other apps in <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.monitor</strong>.


    <li>A BD disc image with A/V assets, ready to have the three xlets
        described above added to it.  Put these together on a BD-RE disc,
	and you have a disc image you can play on an off-the-shelf
	Blu-Ray Disc player, like the PS/3!
    <li>A tool to build a Blu-ray Disc BDJO file 
    in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdjo</strong>, under the tools directory.
    <li>A tool to sign a Blu-ray Disc jar files 
    in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdsigner</strong>, under the tools directory.
    <li>A set of ant scripts you can use to build the tools and the xlets. 
    <li>A set of shell scripts you can use as a starting point to set up a 
build environment.  These can be found in the &quot;scripts&quot; directory.
</ul> 
<p>For everything but the disc image, you'll need to hook up to 
the SVN repository and 
do a bringover.  That process is described in the java.net pages.  When 
I wrote this, there was a link for &quot;Subversion&quot; under 
&quot;Project tools&quot; that explained how to do this.  We 
keep milestone snapshots in the archived_versions directory of the 
SVN repository.  Each is in a zip file with a long, descriptive name. </p>
<p>
For the disc image, look under "Documents &amp; Files" on the menu bar
on the right, then grab the file 2007_10_hdcookbook_disc_image_no_jar_bdjo.zip.
An earlier version from August is also available, but that version has
an AACS directory and has content protection flags set in the transport
streams.  This was fixed in the October disc image, which is known to
play correctly on a PS/3 (once the xlets are compiled and added to the
image).
</p>
<p> By the way, the name &quot;HD Cookbook&quot; is inspired by the title of a
book on developing interactive applications for Blu-ray Java and the other 
HD optical media format.  
See <a href="http://hdcookbook.com">http://hdcookbook.com</a> for 
more about this book, and a list of other Blu-ray resources. </p>
